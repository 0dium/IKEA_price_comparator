Copy and paste this script (link to the raw version of the IkeaPriceComparison.js: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sn0w5t0rm/Pris-Verglukar/main/IkeaPriceComparison.js) 
in GreaseMonkey (Firefox). https://www.greasespot.net/

This script shows you the price in another country of your choice of the article you're viewing in dark red.

You can change the country you want to see the price of by changing the language const to the country of your choice.
For example: nl/en for the dutch site, in English. se/sv for the swedish site, in Swedish.
You can easily see the language when you go the site and look at the url, the part after www.ikea.com/ will be the language
split by a '/' for example www.ikea.com/se/sv/

Currency can be changed once per day to limit API usage

You can also have the prices converted to other currencies by changing these variables:
  - const language = "nl/nl";     // Input the country code of the website you wish to compare to in this format '../..'
  - const baseCurrency = "EUR";   // The base currency used in the country you are comparing to, (the one you put in above ^^ )
  - const otherCurrency = "EUR";  // The currency you want that article's price to be shown in (the currency you use)
